**** README FOR SAMTOOLS ****

Using the 'homo.bam' file which is the compressed binary version of the SAM file of the chromosome 20 of the human genome.

If we want to extract pieces of the genome into a reduced SAM file, we use the following commands:

  For example, to extract the first 1.000.000 nucleotides:
     samtools view homo.bam 20:1-1000000 > sam_1M.sam
  
  or, in the same way, to extract the first 9 milions:
      samtools view homo.bam 20:1-9000000 > sam_9M.sam
      
      
Another useful tool is to visualize the header of the file:
      samtools view -H homo.bam > header.txt
